# Basics

1. Define and assign a variable to the amount of courses youâ€™re taking this semester. Then define another variable and assign the number of minutes you want to study for each class. Print out the total number of minutes you need to set aside to study each week.

2. Ask the user for their total minutes of screen time yesterday (you can usually find this in settings on Androids and iPhones â€” if not, estimate the number). Assuming that trend stays the same daily, print out the total minutes of screen time the user will spend on their phone a week, month, and year.

3. Using your calculations above, assume the user will live until they are 80 and have used a phone since they were 16. Also assume they sleep 8 hours every day. Print to the console the percent of their lifetime they have spent asleep, on their phone, or doing something else.

4. Write an email generator program that asks the user for their first and last name, and then prints out an email address using their first initial of their first name and their full last name in lower case. Murphy Studebaker -> mstudebaker@chapman.edu
