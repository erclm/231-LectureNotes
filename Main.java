// everything in Java is structured around Classes
// each java file should be named to match the class name
// (here our file is Main.java and our class is Main)
class Main {
  // you will write these words 100s of times this semester
  // this is the main method of your program and is what gets run
  // when your class is executed from the command line
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // we print a message to the console 
    System.out.println("Hello world!");
  }
