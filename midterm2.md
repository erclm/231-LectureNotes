## Practice Problems
1. A class, MyClass, has a non-static method named calculate that takes a double as input and returns a double as output. Write the code that correctly calls the calculate method with input of 12.5 and stores the result in a double variable named temp.
2. We want to write a program to model household appliances. An appliance consists of a serial number (integer), brand (string), category (string), and price in US dollars (double). Write the complete code for a class, Appliance.java, that consists of attributes, default constructor, overloaded constructor, copy constructor, mutators, accessors, equals, and toString methods.
3. Add javadoc comments to your code in problem 3.
4. Write the code to populate an ArrayList with 20 random doubles. Then, write the code to display the values in the list, one per line, in reverse order.
5. A java program, Foo.java, takes several string command line arguments to main when it is run, eg: java Foo these are command line arguments. Write a main method for Foo that prints “Duplicates!” if any of the command line arguments are repeated, and “No Duplicates!” otherwise.
6. What is the purpose of the “this” keyword?
7. In Java, collections are only able to hold Objects. What must be used if we wish to use a collection to store primitives?
8. Declare and instantiate a LinkedList that can be used to store floats.
9. Compare and contrast LinkedLists and ArrayLists. 
10. What are some good applications for HashMaps?
