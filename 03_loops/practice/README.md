# Loops + String Methods

1. Write a program that prompts the user for a list of student exam grades. Keep track of the running total and the number of grades entered. Once the user enters “-1” stop prompting them for more input and print out the average of all of the grades.

2. Write a program that continually asks the user to enter yes/no questions. Your program should randomly output yes or no, based on a probability that 70% of the responses will be no. Once the computer answers yes, the program should quit.

3. Write a file name linter program that asks the user to enter a name of their file, and then prints the file name back out with all spaces replaced with `_` and all letters lowercase. (Example: Computer Science Notes → computer_science_notes). You can allow the user to continue linting file names until they enter “stop”.
